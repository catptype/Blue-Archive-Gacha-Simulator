A hobby project for self-learning in full-stack web development. This web application serves as a **Gacha Simulator** that connects its content to the mobile game, Blue Archive.

## Key Features
- ※**Account System:** An optional choice for users to create an account with extra features.
    - **Dashboard System:** A user control panel for tracking information such as history, statistics, collection, achievements, and user settings.
- **Gacha Simulator:** Simulates the gacha drawing system with probabilities identical to the original game (guest mode available).

**※NOTE※** Since this is a hobby project, I do not intend to collect user information as much as possible.
